lazy-utils is a collection of tiny, permissively-licensed system utilities that
do the absolute minimum required to achieve a security-hardened, fast and tiny,
Linux embedded system.

lazy-utils is meant to complement toybox (http://www.landley.net/toybox/) and
provide a suckless (http://suckless.org/) alternative to
BusyBox (http://www.busybox.net/).

lazy-utils is licensed under a 2-clause BSD license, see COPYING for the license
