lazy-utils is a collection of tiny, permissively-licensed system utilities that
do the absolute minimum required to achieve a security-hardened, fast and tiny,
Linux embedded system.

lazy-utils is meant to provide a no-frolls, BSD-licensed alternative to
toybox (http://www.landley.net/toybox/) and BusyBox (http://www.busybox.net/).
However, lazy-utils does not follow any standard; it tries to balance between
tradition and minimalism, with a tendency towards the latter.

lazy-utils is heavily tied to Lazyux (https://github.com/iguleder/lazyux), a
reference operating system built on top of it, which follows the same ideology.

lazy-utils is licensed under a 2-clause BSD license, see COPYING for the license
text. For a list of its authors and contributors, see AUTHORS.
