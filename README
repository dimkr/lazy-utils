Overview
========

lazy-utils is a permissively-licensed set of system tools that makes it easy to
build a security-hardened, fast and tiny, Linux (https://www.kernel.org/)
embedded system.

lazy-utils provides a no-frills, BSD-licensed alternative to toybox
(http://www.landley.net/toybox/), BusyBox (http://www.busybox.net/) and obase
(https://github.com/chneukirchen/obase). However, lazy-utils is:
  - Neutral: it does not follow any standard or design philosophy (i.e
    multi-call binaries).
  - Small: prefers minimalism over tradition.
  - A mix of original code and larger tools ported from OpenBSD
    (http://www.openbsd.org/) and NetBSD (http://www.netbsd.org/).

Dependencies
============

lazy-utils is designed for static linking and tested against the musl
(http://www.musl-libc.org/) C library.

At run-time, lazy-utils relies on the following file systems:
  - A proc file system mounted at /proc
  - A sysfs file system mounted at /sys
  - A devtmpfs file system mounted at /dev
  - A writable file systems at /tmp
  - A writable file systems at /run

In addition, mergedirs is implemented in user-mode, on top of FUSE
(http://fuse.sourceforge.net/).

Therefore, lazy-utils depends on GNU Linux-libre (http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/)
or Linux (https://www.kernel.org/) of version 2.6.32 or
above, built with CONFIG_SYSFS, CONFIG_PROC_FS, CONFIG_DEVTMPFS and
CONFIG_FUSE_FS on.

Hacking
=======

lazy-utils is written in the C language. All original parts of it rely on C99
features.

Most tools consist of a single source file and placed under the the "utils"
directory. However, bigger ones (such as ksh), which consist of multiple source
files, have their own directory.

All code shared between multiple tools is placed under the "lib" directory, as a
single source file, while BSD compatibility code is placed under the "compat"
directory, to make it easier to copy into the source trees of other projects.

Credits and Legal Information
=============================

The ksh, sed and awk implementations and the compatibility layer were taken from
OpenBSD (http://www.openbsd.org/), MirBSD (https://www.mirbsd.org/) and NetBSD
(http://www.netbsd.org/). They have their own legal information, under the
respective directories.
