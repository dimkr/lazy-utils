Overview
========

lazy-utils is a permissively-licensed set of system tools that complement toybox
(http://www.landley.net/toybox/).

It provides lighweight, independent implementations of init and standard
daemons, suitable for use in lighweight distributions.

In the past, lazy-utils used to be a complete replacement for toybox
(http://www.landley.net/toybox/) and BusyBox (http://www.busybox.net/), but now
it focuses on extra applets or lighter alternatives to existing ones, with
emphasis on short, easy to understand and solid code.

Dependencies
============

lazy-utils is designed for static linking and tested against the musl
(http://www.musl-libc.org/) C library.

At run-time, lazy-utils relies on the following file systems:
  - A proc file system mounted at /proc
  - A sysfs file system mounted at /sys
  - A devtmpfs file system mounted at /dev
  - A writable file systems at /run

Therefore, lazy-utils depends on Linux (http://www.kernel.org/) version 2.6.32
or above, built with CONFIG_SYSFS, CONFIG_PROC_FS and CONFIG_DEVTMPFS on.
